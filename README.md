# Image
This repository contains a project for resizing the image files (jpg, png) in a folder.
The program will
- prompt for a folder and resize factor
- resize each of the (jpg or png) files in the folder
- store the resulting file in a subfolder of the original folder (\<folder\>_edited)

This is an example of using the TKinter GUI interface for prompting the folder and the resize factor.
It also uses the PILLOW library for manipulating images.
